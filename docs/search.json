Consider your audience carefully\nWhen you read the following examples - you are the audience for these summaries. Do they include the key pieces of information you need to understand the research?

Not only do they need to digest something fairly complex, but you’re now also asking them to remember a new abbreviation or term.\nIf you need to use a sentence to explain what a technical idea or term is, that can be ok! Better than assuming the audience already knows what you’re talking about.\n4. When you’re done, step back and make sure your summary makes a step by step logical argument. \nEach new sentence needs to be supported by the previous ones and lead to the next sentence. If there is a break in the logic, it’s harder for the audience to follow and understand your study.\n5. Finally - read your paragraph out loud to yourself.\nIt’s much easier to catch errors or sentences that don’t quite flow when you read it outloud. This keeps our brains from skipping over errors because we know what we meant to say.\n\n\n\n\nCreate your slide deck (ideally, no more than 5 slides).\nFocus on diagrams, pictures, figures rather than words\nConsider how you can use your “And, But, Therefore” pitch to introduce and previewq the talk for your audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpilepsy affects 600,000 people in the UK AND is often treated using anti-epileptic drugs. BUT for 30% of people with epilepsy these drugs fail to control their seizures. THEREFORE scientists are looking at new types of treatment which will work better.\nWhat works, and what doesn’t?\n\n\n\nThe UK has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 AND has made good progress in reducing emissions from electricity generation. BUT emissions from transport have not fallen. THEREFORE the government needs to take action to reduce emissions from cars and lorries.\n\n\n\nOf the 800,000 people who have a stroke in the US every year, one third are diagnosed with aphasia, a language disorder that impairs our ability to communicate with our friends, familiy, and colleagues. AND Speech-Language Pathologists use standardized tests to assess language abilities in people with aphasia BUT these tests are often too time-consuming for routine clinical care and contain out-of-date and culturally insensitive stimuli. THEREFORE, our study will use computational modeling and item-response theory to develop and validate an efficient, adpative, and culturally sensitive language assessment for today’s clinical practice.\n\n\n\nOlder sexual and gender minority adults face a higher burden of frailty as well as mental health issues AND frailty and mental health issues are risk factors for the use of potentially inappropriate medications. BUT the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications is unknown among older sexual and gender minority adults. THEREFORE, it is critical to evaluate the use and adverse outcomes of potentially inappropriate medication use particularly in this population. In my study, I am assessing whether older sexual and gender minorit adults use a higher prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications compared to cisgender heterosexual older adults.\n\n\n\nRural Maine has experienced a significant decline in obstetrics facilities, leading to decreased access to maternal healthcare. AND This decline is concerning as it correlates with poorer maternal and child health outcomes and increased travel times for essential care. BUT the challenges leading to rural obstetrics closures are not fully understood due to the diversity of the hospital settings. THEREFORE, we seek to identify key factors and develop targeted strategies to support and sustain the rural obstetrics workforce by conducting site visits and interviews with nurses, providers, and administrators at these locations.\nBisphosphonates are widely used to treat osteoporosis and other bone diseases, AND there is growing interest in their potential off-label effects, including the prevention of dementia. Observational studies have suggested a possible association between bisphosphonate use and reduced dementia risk, sparking significant scientific and public interest. BUT observational studies are prone to biases and confounding factors that can obscure the true causal relationship, making it challenging to determine whether bisphosphonates genuinely have a protective effect against dementia or if the observed associations are due to other factors. THEREFORE we are designing a target trial, which is the randomized controlled trial we would conduct in an ideal world, and will emulate it using observational data in order to rigorously assess the potential off-label effects of bisphosphonates on preventing dementia.\nMaine’s newly enacted paid family and medical leave law will provide support for working mothers to take time off from work after the birth of a child. AND Similar policies in other states have been shown to improve maternal mental health, breastfeeding practices, and postpartum care attendance. BUT no states with significant rural populations have implemented such a leave policy, so we lack understanding of how its effects on maternal health may differ between urban and rural populations. This gap hinders the ability to tailor policies to meet the unique needs of diverse populations. THEREFORE we are collecting data by surveying people around the state in their first year postpartum before and after the law goes into effect in order to inform policymakers and stakeholders on the effectiveness and adaptability of paid leave policies for varied populations.\n\n\n\nThe All of Us research program is a billion-dollar national effort to gather data from one million or more people living in the United States to accelerate research and precision medicine. The All of Us Research Program data is widely available to health researchers BUT using this data for complex research questions still requires a relatively high level of technical expertise, which poses a barrier to many researchers. THEREFORE, We developed the allofus R package to increase research and training capacity, reduce barriers to entry, and help researchers conduct complex analyses using best practices for reproducibility and transparency.\n\n\n\nThe effective mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA was challenged by unpredictable intervention outcomes due to a gap in integrating health, mobility, social behavior, and demographic data into models. AND Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like lockdowns had adverse long-term effects and varied efficacy based on factors such as socioeconomic status (SES). BUT Current models either oversimplify transmission or lack socioeconomic factors, limiting their ability to understand the dynamics and effiveness of NPIs. THEREFORE we propose using detailed patient-level healthcare data and explainable AI (xAI) to better understand socioeconomic and behavioral predictors of disease spread. This approach will enhance Agent Based Models (ABMs), enabling more realistic simulations and effective mitigation strategies.\n\n\n\nDiabetes affects 1 in 10 adults in the U.S. AND continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) significantly improve diabetes outcomes. BUT not everyone who uses a CGM will necessarily benefit equally. THEREFORE my study will use the Target Trials framework to estimate the causal effect of CGM use on racial disparities in type 2 diabetes outcomes."
